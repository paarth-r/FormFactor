So if you're reading this, Hi;

I'm Paarth, and I designed and built this system.
Pretty impressive for a 14 year old, if I do say so myself.
The code should be easy enough to understand;
if you need any help just send me an email at paarth.rajpal@gmail.com
OR
just drop me a text at +1(669) 282-0617.

Wait a second...
What are you even doing here?
The system is literally self reliant.
It's machine learning, you not touching it is kind of the point.
No touchie the code...





Unless you happen to be Paarth, in which case, read the following

Dear Me,

What the heck dude?! I thought we were good at coding?
Did we actually mess this s#!t up? Wowww. Nice job buddy.

Let's try to not make a jacked gymbro terminator robot thing;
humanity isn't even that overrated.
